#Version Control System

hello world.

I'm Amalina and this is a test repository on using version control system GIT with Github :)

I am more familiar with bitbucket but this works pretty much the same!

Next: I'm going to try stash. 

When you have uncommitted files and you want to work on something else or pull remote files that are conflicting with current changes, use stash!
