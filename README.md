#Version Control System

hello world.

I'm Amalina and this is a test repository on using version control system GIT with Github :)

I am more familiar with bitbucket but this works pretty much the same!

Next: I'm going to try stash. 

Stash is when you have uncommitted files and you want to work on something else or pull fron remote that is conflicting with current changes, use stash!
